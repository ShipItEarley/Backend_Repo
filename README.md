# Backend Development Journey 🚀

Welcome to my journey of mastering the essentials of building robust backend systems! This repository is a work-in-progress showcase of my progress as I delve into key backend concepts, technologies, and frameworks.

---

## 🌟 Goal

To become proficient in designing and implementing secure, scalable, and efficient backend systems by mastering the following:

- **JWT Authentication**: Implementing secure user authentication and authorization.
- **CRUD Operations**: Performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations with databases.
- **REST API Endpoints**: Designing and building RESTful APIs for seamless client-server communication.
- **Cutting-Edge Technologies**: Exploring and applying the latest backend tools, frameworks, and best practices.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools

Throughout this journey, I’ll work with the following:

- **Languages**: JavaScript (Node.js), Python
- **Frameworks**: Express.js, FastAPI (planned)
- **Databases**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT), OAuth (planned)
- **Other Tools**: Postman, Docker, Git/GitHub

## 📂 Project Structure

Each stage of my learning is organized into directories for easy navigation:

- `01-jwt-authentication/`: Examples and practice of JWT-based secure login systems.
- `02-crud-database-operations/`: CRUD operations with MongoDB and PostgreSQL.
- `03-rest-api-endpoints/`: Building REST APIs with proper routing and middleware.
- `04-advanced-backend/`: Implementing advanced backend features like caching, WebSockets, and more.
