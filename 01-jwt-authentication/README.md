## 📖 Milestone 1: JWT Authentication

This project is the first step in my journey to mastering backend development. It focuses on setting up a simple backend server using **Node.js** and **Express.js** to lay the groundwork for implementing secure JWT Authentication.

### 🛠️ Key Features
- Basic HTTP server setup using **Express.js**.
- `GET` request handling for the root endpoint.
- Auto-reloading server setup with **nodemon** for development efficiency.

### 🚀 Future Plans
This chapter sets the stage for:
- Implementing JWT-based user authentication.
- Adding user registration and login functionality.
- Protecting routes using middleware for token validation.
